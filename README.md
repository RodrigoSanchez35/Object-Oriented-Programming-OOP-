  - Calculates rental invoices with **IVA (19%)** and applicable **discounts**.
  - **Discounts**:
    - **Cargo Vehicles**: 3%
    - **Passenger Vehicles**: 7%
- **Exception Handling**: Uses `try-catch` blocks to prevent runtime errors.
- **Multithreading**: Implements **concurrent processing** for efficient data handling.
- **File Handling**: Reads/writes vehicle records using external files.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides an intuitive interface for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: NetBeans IDE
- **Data Structures**: Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threading
- **File I/O**: BufferedReader, FileWriter
